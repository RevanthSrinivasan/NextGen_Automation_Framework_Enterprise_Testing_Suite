A Next-Gen BDD automation framework built with Selenium, Cucumber, TestNG, and Maven, designed for scalable UI, API, ETL, and Mobile testing. 
Features include config-driven execution, thread-safe driver management, scenario-level dependency injection, and a clean, extensible architecture aligned with enterprise automation standards. 
Built with enterprise automation best practices, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and parallel execution.

Detailed Overview
Title: Next-Gen Enterprise Automation Framework (BDD-Driven | UI | API | Scalable)

Description:

  * This project is a Next-Generation, enterprise-grade automation framework built using Selenium, Cucumber (BDD), TestNG, and Maven, designed to support UI, API, ETL, and Mobile automation within a single unified test suite.

  * The framework follows clean architecture principles and uses Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to ensure readability, reusability, and collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

  * It implements a config-driven execution model, thread-safe WebDriver management, and scenario-level dependency injection using PicoContainer, enabling reliable parallel execution without static state issues.

Key features include:

  * BDD-based test design using Cucumber & Gherkin

  * Thread-safe DriverManager with WebDriverManager integration

  * ScenarioContext & TestContext for safe data sharing across steps

  * FrameworkInitializer for centralized configuration, logging, and setup

  * Configurable browser and environment support

  * Scalable structure to extend API (Rest Assured), ETL, and Mobile (Appium) automation

This framework is designed with real-world enterprise automation standards in mind and serves as a foundation for building robust, maintainable, and scalable test automation solutions.
