🚀 Overview: The Unified Automation Solution
This project introduces a Next-Generation, enterprise-grade automation framework built on a robust foundation of Selenium, Cucumber (BDD), TestNG, and Maven.

It is engineered to be a single, unified test suite capable of supporting diverse testing needs:

🖥️ UI Automation

🌐 API Testing (Extensible to Rest Assured)

📱 Mobile Testing (Extensible to Appium)

🗃️ ETL / Data Testing

Built with enterprise automation best practices, it focuses intensely on scalability, maintainability, and reliable parallel execution.

⭐ Key Architectural Features
Our design adheres to clean architecture principles and focuses on eliminating common pitfalls in large-scale test automation.

BDD & Collaboration:

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Cucumber & Gherkin ensures test cases are readable and serve as living documentation, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Reliable Parallel Execution:

Thread-Safe DriverManager with WebDriverManager integration guarantees isolated driver instances for flawless parallel runs without static state contamination.

Scenario-Level Dependency Injection (PicoContainer) for safe data sharing across steps via dedicated ScenarioContext and TestContext.

Configurable & Extensible:

Config-Driven Execution Model: Easily switch between browsers, environments, and execution modes via centralized configuration.

Framework Initializer: Centralized point for configuration loading, sophisticated logging, and environment setup.

Enterprise Standards:

Designed as a foundational template, offering a highly extensible architecture that aligns with real-world enterprise automation standards.
